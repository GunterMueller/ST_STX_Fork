<h2>Corrections</h2><h3>Using Final</h3>
<P>Paul Haahr kindly pointed out to me that I've not been accurate with the use of <code>final</code> in this refactoring. The point that I missed is that you can't use a final field if the initialization is done in a separate method to the constructor. This the example at the bottom of page 301 (that uses <code>initialize(id)</code>) just does not compile. (My apologies for not testing that fragment, some do slip through the net....) If you want to use a separate method, you can't make the field final</P>
<P> This also means that the mechanics is incorrect. Making the field final should be the last step not the first, and can only be done if it's possible. </P>
